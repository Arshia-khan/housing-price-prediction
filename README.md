# House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices using machine learning models based on various features from the Ames Housing dataset.

## Project Structure

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluation (RMSE, R² Score)
- Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)

## Dataset

The dataset is from the [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset).  
It contains details like lot size, number of rooms, neighborhood, and year built.

## Model Performance
